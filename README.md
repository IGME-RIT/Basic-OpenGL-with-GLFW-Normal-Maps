# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: Normal Maps

This program introduces basic concepts involved in writing an OpenGL program.

# About

Using mesh and texture information, we can make lighting account for small variations in surfaces.
In this example, a normal map, and additional vertex information are used to achieve this effect.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
